reproduction of the simulations of a critical paper, with the State Space formulation of Granger Causality
The files Example1.m and Example2.m are meant to reproduce the simulations of the paper "A study of problems encountered in Granger causality analysis from a neuroscience perspective", PNAS vol. 114 no. 34 E7063â€“E7072, doi: 10.1073/pnas.1704663114 http://www.pnas.org/content/114/34/E7063.abstract , using both the formulation in which full and reduced vector autoregressive models are fitted separately, leading to a bias or variability, and the State Space formulation, allowing closed form computation of Granger Causality, greatly reducing both bias and variability.
